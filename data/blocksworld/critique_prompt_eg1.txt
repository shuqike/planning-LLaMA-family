I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.

You will be given the history of a past experience in which I was placed in an environment and given a task to complete. I was unsuccessful in completing the task. Do not summarize the environment, but rather think about the strategy and path I took to attempt to complete the task. Devise a concise, new plan of action that accounts for my mistake with reference to specific actions that I should have taken. For example, if I tried A and B but forgot C, then devise a plan to achieve C with environment-specific actions. I will need this later when I am solving the same task. Give your reflection and critic after "[Critic]".

[GOAL] My goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the red block.
[STATE 0] I have that, the red block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.
[ACTION 1] Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block.
[STATE 1] I have that, the orange block is clear, the red block is clear, the yellow block is in the hand, the hand is holding the yellow block, the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on the table, and the orange block is on the table.
[ACTION 2] Stack the yellow block on top of the red block.
[STATE 2] I have that, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the blue block is on the table, and the orange block is on the table.
[ACTION 3] Pick up the orange block.
[STATE 3] I have that, the orange block is in the hand, the yellow block is clear, the hand is holding the orange block, the red block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, and the blue block is on the table.
[Critic] The mistake in your strategy is that once you stacked the yellow block on top of the red block, the red block was no longer clear. This means you could not directly stack the orange block on top of the red block, which was the goal. In your steps, you had picked up the orange block, but with the yellow block on top of the red block, there was no direct way to achieve the goal from that state.

[Critic] In your actions, the major mistake was the placement of the yellow block on top of the red block in ACTION 2. Your goal was to have the orange block on top of the red block. By placing the yellow block on top of the red block, you essentially blocked yourself from easily achieving your goal.
