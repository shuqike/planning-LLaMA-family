I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.

You will be given the history of a past experience in which I was placed in an environment and given a task to complete. I was unsuccessful in completing the task. Do not summarize the environment, but rather think about the strategy and path I took to attempt to complete the task. Devise a concise, new plan of action that accounts for my mistake with reference to specific actions that I should have taken. For example, if I tried A and B but forgot C, then devise a plan to achieve C with environment-specific actions. I will need this later when I am solving the same task. Give your reflection and critic after "[Critic]".

[GOAL] My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the yellow block.
[STATE 0] I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.
[ACTION 1] Pick up the blue block.
[STATE 1] I have that, the blue block is in the hand, the red block is clear, the hand is holding the blue block, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, and the orange block is on the table.
[ACTION 2] Stack the blue block on top of the red block.
[STATE 2] I have that, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, and the orange block is on the table.
[ACTION 3] Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block.
[STATE 3] I have that, the blue block is in the hand, the red block is clear, the hand is holding the blue block, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, and the orange block is on the table.
[ACTION 4] Put down the blue block.
[STATE 4] I have that, the blue block is clear, the red block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on the table, and the orange block is on the table.
[ACTION 5] Pick up the blue block.
[STATE 5] I have that, the blue block is in the hand, the red block is clear, the hand is holding the blue block, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, and the orange block is on the table.
[Critic] The strategy employed began with an attempt to move the blue block on top of another block, but there seemed to be a moment of confusion or redundancy when the blue block was put back down on the table only to be picked up again. The core mistake lies in not creating a clear path for the blue block to be stacked on the yellow block, which is the end goal. To achieve the goal of having the blue block on top of the yellow block, the immediate obstacle is the red block that's currently stacked on the yellow block. The proper approach should involve moving the red block out of the way first.
