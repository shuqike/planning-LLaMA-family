I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.

You will be given the history of a past experience in which I was placed in an environment and given a task to complete. I was unsuccessful in completing the task. Do not summarize the environment, but rather think about the strategy and path I took to attempt to complete the task. Devise a concise, new plan of action that accounts for my mistake with reference to specific actions that I should have taken. For example, if I tried A and B but forgot C, then devise a plan to achieve C with environment-specific actions. I will need this later when I am solving the same task. Give your reflection and critic after "[Critic]".

[GOAL] My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.
[STATE 0] I have that, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, the red block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.
[ACTION 1] Pick up the orange block.
[STATE 1] I have that, the orange block is in the hand, the yellow block is clear, the hand is holding the orange block, the blue block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, and the red block is on the table.
[ACTION 2] Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block.
[STATE 2] I have that, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, and the red block is on the table.
[ACTION 3] Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block.
[STATE 3] I have that, the orange block is in the hand, the yellow block is clear, the hand is holding the orange block, the blue block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, and the red block is on the table.
[ACTION 4] Put down the orange block.
[STATE 4] I have that, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, the orange block is on the table, and the red block is on the table.
[ACTION 5] Pick up the orange block.
[STATE 5] I have that, the orange block is in the hand, the yellow block is clear, the hand is holding the orange block, the blue block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, and the red block is on the table.
[Critic] The strategy used in the given history was ineffective towards achieving the goal. The main error was the premature attempt to stack the orange block on the yellow block without first addressing the positioning of the blue block and yellow block. Picking up, putting down, and re-picking the orange block was redundant and non-productive, resulting in no progress towards the goal. The critical step missed in the original strategy is dealing with the blue and yellow blocks' arrangement first before engaging with the orange block.

[Critic] The approach taken diverged from the direct path to achieve the goal. The key to solving this is to focus on creating a clear base for the blocks you want to stack in the correct order. To correct this and achieve the goal, we should first clear the yellow and blue blocks from their incorrect positions.
